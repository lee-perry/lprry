# Default Apps

On this page I keep a record of the applications that I regularly use.

## 📧 Email

I am only part way through migrating my email provider out of iCloud. I currently use Apple Mail for emails received in to my legacy icloud addresses, and Proton for email being received at this domain.

## 🌐 Browser

I use [Orion](https://orionbrowser.com) from Kagi as my main browser. I also use [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) as a backup browser, particularly for some sites that require a chromium based browser to work fully - like Scrimba.
