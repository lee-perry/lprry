 <h1>What's in my inventory?</h1>
<p>2025-11-05</p>
<p>Hosted by <a href="https://blog.absurdpirate.com/bear-blog-carnival-november-whats-in-my-inventory/">Absurd Pirate</a>, the writing prompt for this month's bearblog carnival is focused on the items that we carry around on a daily basis.  If my sprite was to expire, what would be left behind.</p>
<p>Selfishly, my minimalist approach to taking items anywhere with me, means that this is a relatively easy topic to talk about.  I decided about a year ago to revert back to an earlier experiment in which my mobile phone doubles as my wallet.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/img_4515.webp" alt="A picture showing an iPhone in fold out case with card inserts, and airpods"></p>
<p>Should my sprite suddenly get cornered by the snarks and expire into the long summer, all that would be left behind is my phone, and my airpods.</p>
<h2>Phone</h2>
<p>My phone is an iPhone 13 that I have owned for around 4 years now.  For quite a while I only carried a work phone, but in a tough period at work at a previous employer I decided to get myself a new phone and contract - picking up an iPhone 13 which is still going strong.  I avoid carrying two phones around again now, with a digital work SIM also installed in the same phone.</p>
<p>My digital life has revolved around Apple for a number of years now, though I'm really weighing that up as they continue to chum up with the orange bawbags.  So I'm reconsidering my digital setup with changes likely over the next year, but staying on topic that means that at some point my iPhone will likely be replaced by something that is neither iOS nor Android or Android derived.</p>
<p>My phone is pretty central to what I do, it is my digital and ticket wallet, my camera, I post to bearblog from it, and I consume RSS and read eBooks on it too.  So getting the replacement right is going to be important.</p>
<h2>Case</h2>
<p>My case is a leather folding case from Torro, which I really like, in black with red trim.  The case has three sleeves on the inside of the leaf, with a bigger pouch behind.  My sprite is very unlikely to leave any cash behind, but there will be a couple of payment cards and ID in there, as well as my Burnley FC season ticket, and my membership card for the Boulder UK bouldering center in Preston.</p>
<h2>Airpods</h2>
<p>My sprite will probably also expire because it was not paying attention to its surroundings while listening intently to Hole or My Chemical Romance through my original Airpods Pro - which I actually picked up at a very similar time to my phone.  If my sprite is feeling sensible though, it may well be listening to the Rest is Politics podcast instead.</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<p>On the rare occasion that I actually leave the house properly, there may also be a key to my Nissan Leaf EV in my possession, though I very rarely carry a house key - usually Vickie will be in the house if I am not.</p>
