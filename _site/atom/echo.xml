         <br />
       
   
       Fresh from my shock at finding Starbucks open for my 6am train came my shock at buying my first ever +£7 coffee.  Finishing off last nights work getting image transforms and feeds working together in the first 15 minutes of my journey did soften the blow.

       I've made good progress on my 11ty site this weekend with new topic archives collating content types for each topic, and linking through from content meta sections, with a topics index page.  I'm struggling to paginate archive pages though due to the dynamic content filtering inside my templates.
