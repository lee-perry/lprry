    <id>https://l.prry.uk/articles/2025-07-10-hello-bear/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve probably finally reached the point where I&#39;m actually happy with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://lee-perry.co.uk&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.  So surely I&#39;m not seriously contemplating rebuilding the whole thing?  Sure I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://l.prry.uk/assets/images/24-1.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot from the microfeed page on my Kirby CMS powered website&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve built a website that does exactly what I want it to, but there is a certain amount of complexity to it that I would like to simplify.  I&#39;ve been thinking a lot recently about rebuilding on a hosted solution flitting between &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, which I have used previously and like a lot, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bearblog.dev&quot;&gt;bearblog.dev&lt;/a&gt; which I have not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest barriers to considering Bear for me was the absence of webmention support. That is one of the features that I like the most in my current setup, though at times it can also be amongst the most frustrating!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://l.prry.uk/assets/images/49-1.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing current webmention and comment functionality on my existing website&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been considering micro.blog more than Bear, due to the webmention and ActivityPub support. I knew though that the discarding of specific types of webmentions and interactions would frustrate me - it did previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;https://gobino.be/adding-webmentions-to-my-blog-tutorial/&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://gobino.be&quot;&gt;gobino&lt;/a&gt; walking through implementation of webmentions on their Bear based site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also spent a lot of time building out the interface with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lee-perry.co.uk/wiki&quot;&gt;digital garden&lt;/a&gt; section of my website. Though I think that I can make that work much more efficiently using the Bear &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.bearblog.dev/embedding-blog-post-lists/&quot;&gt;content slices&lt;/a&gt; that I have seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also did not want to mess around building one website on a temporary domain, while potentially deprecating another - after all, this experiment may fail.  The last time I rebuilt the site, I actually blogged very little for the following 6 weeks or so because of this.  So after 21 years I&#39;ve also decided to build this out on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://l33.co.uk&quot;&gt;new, shorter, domain&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;m much less bothered about loss of domain authority than I&#39;ve ever been before - even though an extraordinary number of people still use my instructions &lt;a href=&quot;https://lee-perry.co.uk/notes/2023-05-31-install-championship-manager-01-02-on-macos-in-2023&quot;&gt;to play CM0102 on Mac&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that feels like a deal to me.  Building in public, I&#39;m going to attempt to recreate my entire website here on Bear, lets see how it goes...  If this works the content migration is going to take a very long time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the next update...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Using Microformats with Bear</title>
    <link href="https://l.prry.uk/articles/2025-07-11-using-microformats-with-bear/" />
    <updated>2025-07-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://l.prry.uk/articles/2025-07-11-using-microformats-with-bear/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Microformats are tiny snippets of class data within html return author, title, date and content to indieWeb tools that rely on microformats to obtain structured data about your content for use elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty abstract for the most part, but important if you want to participate directly in the IndieWeb as my &lt;a href=&quot;https://lee-perry.co.uk&quot;&gt;main site&lt;/a&gt; does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem that I solved last night was to create the h-card on my homepage, which is a short introduction to your site.  This was easy, and worked immediately, inserting the following code into the &#39;home&#39; section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;h-card&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;a class=&amp;quot;h-card p-name u-url&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://l33.co.uk/&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;me&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;display: none;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Lee Perry&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p-note&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/leeperry/header.webp&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;u-photo u-featured&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;max-width: 50%; border-radius: 20px; float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom:20px; border: 2px solid whitesmoke&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Burnley based, I run, ride online, climb rocks and mountains, and explore the world in our motorhome with my Social Secretary, Vickie.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Expect lots of talk about running, virtual cycling on my Wattbike Atom (NG), Burnley FC, retrogaming and code.  Accompanied by lots of cute photographs of our podenco oriented spaniel infiltrated family. Find out what I&#39;m up to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/now/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;now&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;	
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://l.prry.uk/assets/images/47.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot from the front page of my Bear website showing my h-card ash the top of the page&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy enough so far, but my first real frustrations with bear were about to begin.  As far as I can tell the only difference between the themes available in Bear is the css applied to them, so it would be super simple to make microformats work out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I very quickly came up with a way through the post template to implement microformats, but that is exposed in the post editor for every post, which is ugly.  I had hoped to insert the opening tags into the header settings, and information and closing tags into the footer settings.  This did not work though, header settings insert in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; section of the html, and there is no obvious way to control the appearance of the footer settings on pages that are not posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now I have inserted the opening tags at the top of the post editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;article class=&amp;quot;h-entry&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;e-content&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I have created an information section at the bottom of the post template (with closing &lt;code&gt;article&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; tags in the footer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;#&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p-name&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;u-url&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;time datetime=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;dt-published&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/time&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; by &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;author&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;h-card p-author&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Lee Perry&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; last updated:  ago.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the lovely plaintext markdown view now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://l.prry.uk/assets/images/36-1.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing the bear post editor with microformats code above and below&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not as obtrusive as my earlier attempts, but I dislike this and it could be a dealbreaker with either microformats coming out, or this site not being viable beyond this experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://l.prry.uk/assets/images/56.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing a post on this website passing the h-entry tests on indiewebify&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the site now passes the microformats tests on &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.prry.uk/articles/2025-07-11-using-microformats-with-bear/indiewebify.me&quot;&gt;indiewebify&lt;/a&gt; - but I do need to work out whether I can live with that, or without microformats.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Setting a favicon and site logo in Bear</title>
    <link href="https://l.prry.uk/articles/2025-07-11-a-favicon-and-site-logo-in-bear/" />
    <updated>2025-07-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://l.prry.uk/articles/2025-07-11-a-favicon-and-site-logo-in-bear/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Setting a personalised favicon for your website is one of the features that can help your site&#39;s tab stand out in the browser for the reader.  I designed a wee favicon for my website a while back.  I&#39;m not especially creative, so while it might not be particularly special, I wanted to see if I could work out how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was easy enough.  As I am experimenting with a paid bear plan[^1] I can insert media, so on the home tab of the bear dashboard I have used the insert media link to upload my icon, and from there copied the url into the &lt;code&gt;meta_image&lt;/code&gt; property in the frontmatter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://l.prry.uk/assets/images/59.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the Bear &#39;home&#39; dashboard with favicon url pointing towards an uploaded file&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t really expect this to work, partly as the upload had converted the file to webp- but I flicked across to Vivaldi, and sure enough my logo appeared at the top of the tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then thought that it would be really cool to replace my site name at the top of the page with my logo, as it appears in my existing design.  I failed to come up with a decent css replacement method to achieve that so instead I used css to hide display of the title class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.title {
  display: none;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I used html to insert the same logo into the beginning of the navigation menu, linking through to the homepage, and providing a class for styling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/leeperry/favicon.webp&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;logo&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;logo&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; [Home](/) [Blog](/blog/) [Now](/now)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the result, the end of my first session looking at styling in Bear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://l.prry.uk/assets/images/35.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing my site logo appearing both in the browser tab, and at the front of my navigation menu&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my next update I&#39;ll look at adding an h-card to the home page in bear, to identify the site on the indieWeb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: A paid plan is necessary to upload media to Bear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Starting Over</title>
    <link href="https://l.prry.uk/articles/2025-08-31-starting-over/" />
    <updated>2025-08-31T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://l.prry.uk/articles/2025-08-31-starting-over/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been learning to write code on and off for over a decade now, making plenty of progress along the way, but rarely with sufficient consistency to make it &#39;stick&#39;.  Certainly not adequate to build any of the projects that I would like to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That inconsistency, combined with being fairly/partly proficient, makes it really difficult to just pick up a MOOC course and follow it through from the beginning.  It&#39;s pretty boring relearning simple concepts to pick up the 2% that you may not know or that has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to try just that though.  I&#39;ve had a Scrimba subscription for a number of years, have always enjoyed the program, but have struggled to maintain progress for a variety of reasons, many external to the learning itself.  Scrimba have also recently introduced the back end to create a full-stack learning path for the first time too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ve cleared my course and submission history, starting over from the beginning.  I&#39;ll be blogging about the journey here, partly to consolidate learning, partly to keep myself accountable, and part about rebelling against use of big tech, and finding alternatives where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I completed the Intro to HTML module in the HTML and CSS Fundamentals course today.  The assignment at the end of the module is to create a personal website, though really this task is html only - the stylesheet is provided and controlled by variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the html that I provided to meet the design specification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;styles.css&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;link href=&amp;quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Bangers&amp;amp;family=Black+Ops+One&amp;amp;family=Creepster&amp;amp;family=La+Belle+Aurore&amp;amp;family=MedievalSharp&amp;amp;family=Orbitron&amp;amp;family=Rye&amp;amp;display=swap&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;index.js&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;!-- 
		Challenge 1:
		Write the HTML for your personal website.
		--&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;lee.webp&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hi, my name is Lee&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Fun facts about me:&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
			&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I watch Burnley FC&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
			&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I write about playing old video games&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
			&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I build things with code for fun&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please connect with me on mastodon &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://prry.uk/@lee&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; placeholder=&amp;quot;Enter email...&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;Join newsletter&amp;lt;/button
	&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output is shown below, although the styling was largely provided I think this shows how minimal code is required to create something like a personal linktree page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://l.prry.uk/assets/images/48.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a personal website with avatar, key interests, and follow buttons&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scrimba curriculum uses Github and Netlify, neither fit well with trying to find privacy conscious EU based alternatives to big tech.  So I have set myself up with a couple of alternatives for the first time.  I am trying out &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeberg.org&quot;&gt;Codeberg&lt;/a&gt; in place of Github, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://statichost.eu&quot;&gt;Statichost&lt;/a&gt; in place of Netlify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far everything has gone to plan, and though this initial exercise deploys manually rather than from codeberg, I have my SSH keys setup ready and verified in codeberg ready to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View the project on Statichost &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrimba-personal-website.statichost.eu/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scrimba Business Card Project</title>
    <link href="https://l.prry.uk/articles/2025-09-05-scrimba-business-card-project/" />
    <updated>2025-09-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://l.prry.uk/articles/2025-09-05-scrimba-business-card-project/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I wrote my first article on this site &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.prry.uk/starting-over/&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; I explained that I had decided to work back through the Scrimba curriculum from the beginning to try to really master the basics before moving forwards to more complicated projects.I also explained that I was trying to complete the project with alternatives to big tech - Codeberg and Statichost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first exercise builds a simple html and css business card, customised on the back of a walk through project.  The project uses flexbox to split the images and content onto separate columns.  I always struggle to remember flexbox, though it seems straightforward, splitting the direct children of the flexbox container into columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://l.prry.uk/assets/images/17-1.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing a business card with a styled avatar image and information about my interests on blue and claret.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main changes that I made to the project where the introductions of a slight border-radius to the card, another to the avatar, and a light text shadow.  Obviously I also introduced a slight claret and blue Burnley color palette too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first project that I had deployed to Statichost via Codeberg replacing the Github via Netlify workflow in Scrimba.  It worked fine other than needing to enter my Codeberg credentials - I think I cloned via HTTPS rater than SSH, so hopefully this will just work in the next project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://codeberg.org/leeperry/scrimba-business-card.git&quot;&gt;Codeberg Repo&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://leeperry-scrimba-business-card.statichost.eu/&quot;&gt;Deployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fixed width avatar seems to be being vertically stretched as the card lengthens on my deployment - I&#39;ll need to look into how to control that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the next time...&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://l.prry.uk/assets/images/img_7982.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Looking along the course at Hartlepool Parkrun above participants at the start line on a clear day&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started off the day with our annual visit to Hartlepool Parkrun as we are up in the North East for the weekend ahead of the Great North Run tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My legs seem to be moving very well, with good form, and my pace seems to be flying back with Mounjaro induced weight-loss.  On the other hand my endurance and fuelling have definitely taken a hit, feeling out of gas throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I held onto around 5:15/km throughout for a 26:40 finish - my fastest 5km in two years, and my fastest Hartlepool Parkrun.  Very happy with that considering I did not have the energy to hit the pedal - though I&#39;ll need to ease off considerably tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Great North Run 2025</title>
    <link href="https://l.prry.uk/articles/2025-07-09-great-north-run/" />
    <updated>2025-09-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://l.prry.uk/articles/2025-07-09-great-north-run/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://l.prry.uk/assets/images/img_6655.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Me standing infront of the Wylam Brewery, with a lake in-between, ahead of the Great North Run in 2025&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into the Great North Run, I&#39;d been really pleased with my pace, but a bit concerned about fuelling and endurance racing on Mounjaro.  I hoped to get under 2h, but I expected to suffer at some point, coming in around 2:10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather was much nicer than last year, and though it still took us best part of 90 minutes to walk through the funnel to the start, at least it was not in a torrential downpour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The run started quite well, with the first 2km in low 5min/km territory, starting to lose time on the Tyne Bridge though, I would not see 5min/km again for the rest of the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course felt much more congested this time around.  The last two years I&#39;ve started with a later wave to avoid waiting around in the cold at the end for Vickie.  Next year I&#39;ll be running with my own wave.  I seemed to spend to whole race stopping, starting, weaving in, weaving out, just avoiding people walking in groups on the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That wasn&#39;t the only reason I&#39;d miss my goals for the day though, I struggled a little with the heat, and trying to keep my heart rate in the 170s, and not the 180s... ultimately I&#39;d have to settle for low 180s.  I didn&#39;t really have it in my legs, reverting to walking hills between 13 and 19, slipping time at each interval, though I was able to run 19-21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I&#39;d run over the line in 2:22:14 - I&#39;d have slowed by another 8 seconds had I known.  Faster than last year throughout, and running much more, I was surprised and a little disappointed to only be around 4 minutes inside that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next year...&lt;/p&gt;
