       I've made good progress on my 11ty site this weekend with new topic archives collating content types for each topic, and linking through from content meta sections, with a topics index page.  I'm struggling to paginate archive pages though due to the dynamic content filtering inside my templates.

       So I have my site running on 11ty now. I still have a lot of work to do on content ingestion into feeds - I'll probably end up writing a feed template. I need to fix the conflict between my rss and image-transform plugin setup, and to finish various general template improvements.

       I've been enjoying the simplicity of my bearblog, but am torn on whether to keep it, replicate it back into Kirby, or with an eye on the future recreate in maybe 11ty or Astro. Too much choice.

       Installing CDN video hosting into my BearBlog, along with a clips section, with plans to migrate all of my macretro youtube work into my own environ.
       <br />
       <p>In one quick experiment last night, I tested Bunny for video hosting.  That was really simple, embedding an iframe with the video url as src, and applying a minimal amount of styling in the theme to make the borders look better.</p><br /><p>I then added my <a href="/clips">Clips</a> section to the site, which I'll need to replicate on my front page.  If costs are sensible, I will migrate all of my youtube hosted retro gaming content here.</p><br /><p><img src="/assets/images/55-1.webp" alt="Screenshot from my website showing a hosted video player in an iframe"></p><br /><p>It does seem to use a cookie, which I need to look at, but I don't think tracking anything beyond the session.</p><br />

       <p><img src="/assets/images/img_7982.webp" alt="Looking along the course at Hartlepool Parkrun above participants at the start line on a clear day"></p><br /><p>We started off the day with our annual visit to Hartlepool Parkrun as we are up in the North East for the weekend ahead of the Great North Run tomorrow.</p><br /><p>My legs seem to be moving very well, with good form, and my pace seems to be flying back with Mounjaro induced weight-loss.  On the other hand my endurance and fuelling have definitely taken a hit, feeling out of gas throughout.</p><br /><p>I held onto around 5:15/km throughout for a 26:40 finish - my fastest 5km in two years, and my fastest Hartlepool Parkrun.  Very happy with that considering I did not have the energy to hit the pedal - though I'll need to ease off considerably tomorrow.</p><br />
