I've probably finally reached the point where I'm actually happy with my [website](https://lee-perry.co.uk).  So surely I'm not seriously contemplating rebuilding the whole thing?  Sure I am.

I've built a website that does exactly what I want it to, but there is a certain amount of complexity to it that I would like to simplify.  I've been thinking a lot recently about rebuilding on a hosted solution flitting between [micro.blog](https://micro.blog), which I have used previously and like a lot, and [bearblog.dev](https://bearblog.dev) which I have not.

One of the biggest barriers to considering Bear for me was the absence of webmention support. That is one of the features that I like the most in my current setup, though at times it can also be amongst the most frustrating!

I had been considering micro.blog more than Bear, due to the webmention and ActivityPub support. I knew though that the discarding of specific types of webmentions and interactions would frustrate me - it did previously.  

And then I stumbled upon [this tutorial](https://gobino.be/adding-webmentions-to-my-blog-tutorial/) from [gobino](https://gobino.be) walking through implementation of webmentions on their Bear based site.

I've also spent a lot of time building out the interface with the [digital garden](https://lee-perry.co.uk/wiki) section of my website. Though I think that I can make that work much more efficiently using the Bear [content slices](https://docs.bearblog.dev/embedding-blog-post-lists/) that I have seen.

I also did not want to mess around building one website on a temporary domain, while potentially deprecating another - after all, this experiment may fail.  The last time I rebuilt the site, I actually blogged very little for the following 6 weeks or so because of this.  So after 21 years I've also decided to build this out on a [new, shorter, domain](https://l33.co.uk).  I'm much less bothered about loss of domain authority than I've ever been before - even though an extraordinary number of people still use my instructions [to play CM0102 on Mac](https://lee-perry.co.uk/notes/2023-05-31-install-championship-manager-01-02-on-macos-in-2023)! 

So that feels like a deal to me.  Building in public, I'm going to attempt to recreate my entire website here on Bear, lets see how it goes...  If this works the content migration is going to take a very long time! 

Until the next update...
