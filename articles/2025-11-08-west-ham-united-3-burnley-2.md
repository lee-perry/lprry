Burnley actually started the game well, controlling the first half of the game.  Zian Flemming almost getting on the end of a screaming pass from Hartman, before deservedly heading Burnley ahead in the 36th.

West Ham always looked like they could threaten on the break, and were level just before half time - a fortunate deflection in a goalmouth scramble presenting Callum Wilson with a simple tap-in.

Despite Burnley dominating possession for the next half an hour, there was very little threat save for a Flemming header that went narrowly over. That was punished when West Ham went ahead in the 76th minute, Soucek capitalising on a Dubravka mistake.

West Ham doubled their advantage 8 minutes later, Kyle Walker-Peters tapping in a parried save from Soucek that he could not miss.

The late consolation from Josh Cullen with practically the last kick of the ball was scant consolation.  If we are going to try to sit back and defend every lead we get in this league, then there will be more results like this.

I’m not frustrated by the result, I’m frustrated by the manner of it, and by 90 minutes of awful football, awful gamesmanship, and awful refereeing rewarding it.
