bayLee has been visiting Canine Health and Hydro at Rimington for around 18 months now, ever since complications from a then undiagnosed under-active thyroid caused weight gain, muscle wastage, and back pain.

He is doing really well now, with his weight where it should be, and his pain largely prevented by regular K9 laser and swim sessions here, and ongoing thyroxin medication.

As you can see, his monthly swim sessions are one of the best bits of my month!
