title: Removing Image Transform
date: 2025-12-14
tags: ['indieweb','eleventy','changelog']
description: I've removed image transform from my 11ty site, I was concerned about build time and resource usage once I start to bring legacy content across, replcing it with a webp conversion action in automator on my images folder.  Pagination is the final item left on my initial todo list, but is trickier than it should be due to the dynamic filtration in my templates.
