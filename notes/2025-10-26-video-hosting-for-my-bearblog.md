In one quick experiment last night, I tested Bunny for video hosting.  That was really simple, embedding an iframe with the video url as src, and applying a minimal amount of styling in the theme to make the borders look better.

I then added my [Clips](/clips) section to the site, which I'll need to replicate on my front page.  If costs are sensible, I will migrate all of my youtube hosted retro gaming content here.

It does seem to use a cookie, which I need to look at, but I don't think tracking anything beyond the session.
