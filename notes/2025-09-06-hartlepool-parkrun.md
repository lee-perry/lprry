We started off the day with our annual visit to Hartlepool Parkrun as we are up in the North East for the weekend ahead of the Great North Run tomorrow.

My legs seem to be moving very well, with good form, and my pace seems to be flying back with Mounjaro induced weight-loss.  On the other hand my endurance and fuelling have definitely taken a hit, feeling out of gas throughout.

I held onto around 5:15/km throughout for a 26:40 finish - my fastest 5km in two years, and my fastest Hartlepool Parkrun.  Very happy with that considering I did not have the energy to hit the pedal - though I'll need to ease off considerably tomorrow.
